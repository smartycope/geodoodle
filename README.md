This project is hosted at [https://smartycope.org/geodoodle](https://smartycope.org/geodoodle).

## About
This project is an attempt to recreate the experience of doodling on graph paper. Unlike a traditional drawing program, you can't draw whatever lines you want, it's intentionally constrainted to only allow drawing lines between the intersections of the graph paper.

## Running
- To run normally: `npm start`.
- To run in development mode: `npm run dev`.
- To build: `npm run build`.
- To deploy: `npm run deploy`.
- To run tests: `npm test`.

## History
I've always liked doodling on graph paper. I like making interesting patterns by drawing lines between the intersections. This is basically automated graph paper.

This is the 6th ish iteration of this project. It was my first real programming project, and every time I learn more I end up getting excited and rewriting the project using my new knowledge. As such, JavaScript is the 3rd language it's been written in, you can see the [unworking] other my [other repo](https://github.com/smartycope/GeoDoodle).

Honestly, this is mostly for my own enjoyment. I've tried to fine-tune it and make it as detailed as possible, so feel free to play with it and have fun. But really this is just a hobby project, so if you're looking for actually *useful* software, this probably isn't what you're looking for.

That being said, there are potential applications for it, especially with minor adjustments. For instance, creating quilting patterns (something I eventually intend to get to), planning out floor or yard layouts, or creating dynamic screensavers.

# Getting Started with Create React Nap

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but then again, what isn't?

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, your mom can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it, and your mom, in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console, but you can ignore them.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) to be really bored.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `/proc` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed to Afganistan.

See the section about [your mom](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove your sorry butt from the cockpit.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Making a Progressive Web App

Stop being racist, and try respecting other people's opinions

### Deployment
